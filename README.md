# custom-security-oracle
Provide users the option to increase the security (cost to break threshold) of Tellor by requiring additional staking from reporters.

- fix gov stuff & todos
- make white-listed autopay for ppl staked here
- check if optimizations can be made to autopay
- make faq and address bad ideas for using this (article?) (think about ways can use these contracts instead of chainlink)
